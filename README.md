# About

A Discord bot to display the map hexes from the game Foxhole, this project is something I wanted to try out a while ago, and I finally got the time for it. 
So far the bot can display indivudual Maps/Hexes with the icons, and it can list all the active maps so it can be easily copied. Other commands are for war reports that show casulties etc. and war status which shows general info about the war on the server.

Contributions are welcome, unless they are reasonable and wont affect the bot.
Issues are going to be dealt with depending on the weight of the issue.

# Own hosting

If you want to host the bot, create a `.env` file, outside of `src/` with the variables `TOKEN, MONGODB_STRING, PREFIX`. Then open the command line inside the folder and run `npm start`. Of course please credit me or leave the help command watermark. Otherwise I will take action if I find out.
