# FoxholeWarBot

### The old (Buggy) version of this bot is on this [branch (Click Me!)](http://156.67.30.147:3000/Saniee/FoxholeWarBot/src/branch/old-version/). <br>

It has many issues and crashes often, cause of these issues, I have decided to rewrite the bot from the ground up with Rust.
A feature full programming language that prevents crashes with fancy memory safety and erorr handling. <br><br>
With this feat, there's also the downside of having to write everything myself, from the discord implementation to the image processing. <br><br>
I trust that every user that is currently using this bot so far, will have the patience to see this bot outgrow it's old buggy self, that i've written in a span of a month.
As for how long this will take, I'm really unsure about the timespan. Life finds a way to be intrusive, so don't expect me to be quick. Especially since a rewrite means I'm starting from ground up.<br><br>
The good part of this is that the bot will be crash free, so it won't be offline for however long it can be when I don't notice it crashed. Alongside other new and exciting features, like a scheduled map check, full map render or many others along the road.

# The Plan, A roadmap of sorts...

## So far, the development is in it's early stages. So the early plans are to:

- [x] Functioning map rendering.
- [x] Have all the needed Discord systems implemented.
- Remake the old commands and they're features again, in a new language. Hopefully with better performance and flexibility of changes.
  - [x] get-map
  - [x] war-report
  - [x] war-state
  - [x] set-shard
  - [x] set-visibility
- [ ] Make the first steps of improving the user experience. (Making it easier to search for hexes etc.)
- [ ] Improve Self Hosting ease of use...? `I'm unsure if this bot has been self hosted before.`

### I will be looking into apps (like Trello) that can track the individual progress of detailed features.
