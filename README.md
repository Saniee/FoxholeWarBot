# FoxholeWarBot
Getting general information about the war and rendering maps with team colors!

## About

This bot takes the role of an Informant. It can create a dynamic render for a part of a map with its respective icons, and names (Each colored by the team occupying them so you can see how far the enemy got). You can also get statistics of the Hex or the whole war! 

Contributions are welcome, unless they are reasonable and wont affect the bot.
Issues are going to be dealt with depending on the weight of the issue.

## Own hosting

If you want to host the bot, edit the `config.example.json` file and rename it to `config.json`, edit variables `token, guildId, clientId, MONGODB_STRING`. Then open the command line inside the folder and run `npm run live`. Of course please credit me or leave the help command watermark. Otherwise I will take action if I find out.
